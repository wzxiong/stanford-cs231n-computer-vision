## CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

These past weeks, I have been following the Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. You can find my solutions to the assignment in this repo.

* The assignment one include Classify CIFAR-10 datasets with Knn, SVM, Softmax, Neural Network.

* The assignment two include optimization neuro network method including batch normalization, dropout and provide hands on experience on GPU computing training Convolution Neuro Network. I also find there are exist sample provided in [HERE](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn)
